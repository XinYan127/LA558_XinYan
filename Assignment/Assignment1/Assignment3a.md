# Map1: OpenStreet map

[Open Street map](OSM.html) - Here shows my working address via Open Street Street

## Map 2: PDFmap
[PDF MAP](assign3a.pdf) - I exported an geoPDF version of the map, but I don't have the permission to download the  
Acrobat software, so I didn't check whether it works well or not.

## Map 3: geoJSON map
[geoJSON map](Assignment3a.geojson) - I exported a geoJSON file that only has the fields in the Flps, County name and population.

I also tried to use a html link to do this assignment, but it doesn't show very well, I'll continue to figure out the problem. Here is the [code](Mycode.html)
